### Man Page

To download the [man page](https://bin-cli.github.io/bin-cli/bin.1.html) system-wide:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man{1,5}
sudo wget https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin.1.gz -O /usr/local/share/man/man1/bin.1.gz
```

Or for the current user:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/man/man{1,5}
wget https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin.1.gz -O ~/.local/share/man/man1/bin.1.gz

# If $HOME/.local/share/man is not already in your $MANPATH:
echo 'MANPATH="$HOME/.local/share/man:$MANPATH"' >> ~/.profile
MANPATH="$HOME/.local/share/man:$MANPATH"
```
