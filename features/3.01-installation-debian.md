## Installation on Debian

If you are using Debian, or another Debian-based operating system, you can install Bin CLI by downloading the .deb package:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin-cli.deb
sudo apt install ./bin-cli.deb
```

This includes [man pages](https://bin-cli.github.io/bin-cli/bin.1.html) (`man bin`, `man binconfig`) and [tab completion](#tab-completion).

It will not be upgraded automatically. If you want to be notified when a new version is released, watch [this repo](https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli) (select Watch > Custom > Releases, or Watch > All Activity if you prefer).

To remove it again:

```bash
sudo apt remove bin-cli
```
