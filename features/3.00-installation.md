## Installation

Bin CLI is a single script that you can [download](https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin) to anywhere in your `$PATH`.

To install it system-wide (for all users) in `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -O /usr/local/bin/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bin
```

To install it for the current user only in `$HOME/.local/bin`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
wget https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -O ~/.local/bin/bin
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/bin

# If $HOME/.local/bin is not already in your $PATH:
echo 'PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

<summary><em>What are the system requirements?</em></summary>

> The requirements are minimal:
>
> - Bash 3.x or above
> - [Core Utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html), [BusyBox](https://busybox.net/) or equivalent
>   (specifically `basename`, `chmod`, `dirname`, `mkdir`, `readlink`, `sort`, `tr`, `uniq`)

<summary><em>What if <code>wget</code> is not available?</em></summary>

> You can use `curl` instead:
>
> ```bash
> sudo curl https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -Lo /usr/local/bin/bin
> curl https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -Lo ~/.local/bin/bin
> ```
>
> At least one of `curl` or `wget` are usually installed, or can easily be
> installed, so that covers 99.99% of cases... But just for completeness - you
> can also use [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/docs/cli):
>
> ```bash
> sudo http get https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -do /usr/local/bin/bin
> http get https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -do ~/.local/bin/bin
> ```
>
> Or [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npx):
>
> ```bash
> sudo npx download-cli https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -o /usr/local/bin/
> npx download-cli https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -o ~/.local/bin/
> ```
>
> Or just click [this link](https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin)
