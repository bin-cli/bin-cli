## Installation

Bin CLI is a [single script](https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin) that you can download to anywhere in your `$PATH`.

To install it system-wide (for all users) in `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -O /usr/local/bin/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bin
```

Or to install it for the current user only in `~/bin`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
wget https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -O ~/bin/bin
chmod +x ~/bin/bin

# If ~/bin is not already in your $PATH:
echo 'PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

> You can use `curl` instead:
>
> ```bash
> sudo curl https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -Lo /usr/local/bin/bin
> curl https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -Lo ~/bin/bin
> ```
>
> At least one of `curl` or `wget` are usually installed, or can easily be installed, so that covers 99.99% of cases.
>
> But just for completeness - you can also use [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/docs/cli):
>
> ```bash
> sudo http get https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -do /usr/local/bin/bin
> http get https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -do ~/bin/bin
> ```
>
> Or [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npx):
>
> ```bash
> sudo npx download-cli https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -o /usr/local/bin/
> npx download-cli https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin -o ~/bin/
> ```
