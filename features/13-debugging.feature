  Scenario: Passing --debug returns detailed debugging information
    Given a script '{ROOT}/project/bin/test'
    When I run 'bin --debug test'
    Then it is successful
    And the output contains:
      # I chose "--" for indenting because it has no special meaning in Markdown
      # (unlike "-" or ">" or spaces), so it should be output correctly when
      # pasted into a GitHub issue without a code fence
      """
