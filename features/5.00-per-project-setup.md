## Per-Project Setup

In the root of the repository, create a `bin/` directory. For example:

```bash
mkdir bin
```

Then create some scripts inside it, in the language of your choice, using the text editor of your choice:

```bash
nano bin/sample
```

And make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x bin/*
```

That's all there is to it. Now you can run them:

```bash
bin sample
```

<summary><em>Can I change the directory name?</em></summary>

> Yes - see [custom script directory](#custom-script-directory), below.

<details>
<summary><em>Does the <code>bin/</code> directory have to exist?</em></summary>

> No - if you define all commands [inline in the config file](#inline-commands), you can omit the `bin/` directory.
>
> You can also put the scripts [in the root directory](#custom-script-directory) - but then [subcommands](#subcommands) won't be supported.
