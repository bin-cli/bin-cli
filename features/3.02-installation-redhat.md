## Installation on RedHat

If you are using RedHat, or another RedHat-based operating system, you can install Bin CLI by downloading the .rpm package:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/releases/latest/download/bin-cli.rpm
sudo rpm -i bin-cli.rpm
```

This includes [man pages](https://bin-cli.github.io/bin-cli/bin.1.html) (`man bin`, `man binconfig`) and [tab completion](#tab-completion).

It will not be upgraded automatically.
