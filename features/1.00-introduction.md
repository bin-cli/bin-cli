# Bin CLI â€“ A simple task/script runner

Bin is a simple task runner, designed to be used in code repositories, with scripts written in any programming language.

It automatically [searches in parent directories](#how-it-works), so you can run scripts from anywhere in the project tree. It also supports [aliases](#aliases), [unique prefix matching](#unique-prefix-matching) and [tab completion](#tab-completion), reducing the amount you need to type.

It is implemented as a self-contained Bash script, small enough to bundle with your dotfiles or projects if you want to.  It only requires Bash 3+ and a small number of [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/) commands, so it should work on almost any Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, etc.). On Windows, it can be used via [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).

Collaborators / contributors who choose not to install Bin can run the scripts directly, so you can enjoy the benefits without adding a hard dependency or extra barrier to entry.
