# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please
[report it via GitHub](https://github.com/bin-cli/bin-cli/security/advisories/new)
or email [d@djm.me](mailto:d@djm.me).

Since the main purpose of *Bin CLI* is to run arbitrary code, the ability to run
arbitrary code is not a vulnerability - unless it is in a context where users
wouldn't normally expect code to be executed, such as the command list or during
tab completion.
